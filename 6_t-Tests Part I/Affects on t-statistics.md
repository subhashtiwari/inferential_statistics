As t value is find using sample mean, population mean, Sample standard deviation and sample size.

So, we infer from these that.
    1. The larger the value of Sample mean, the stronger the evidence that mean is greater than population mean.
    2. The smaller the value of Sample mean, the stronger the evidence that mean is less than population mean.
    3. The further the value of of sample mean from population mean the stronger the evidence that mean is not equal to population mean.
