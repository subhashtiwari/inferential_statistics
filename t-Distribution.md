There is another test for the analysis same as that of Z-Scores. But the variation of
t-distribution is different.

t is equal to the ratio of mean difference to the SE ; SE depends on Sample SD with Bessels Correction i.e. division by (sample size(n)-1).

It is though more prone to Error.

So when Sample Size increases:
        1. The t-distribution approaches a normal distribution.
        2. The t-distribution gets skinner tails.
        3. Sample SD (S) approaches sigma.
