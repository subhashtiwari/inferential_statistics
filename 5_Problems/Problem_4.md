Numerous studies have shown that listening to music while studying can improve memory. To demonstrate this phenomenon, 
a researcher obtains a sample of 36 college students and gives them a standardized memory test while they listen to 
background music. Under normal circumstances (without any music), the scores on the test form a normal distribution with mean 25 and SD 6. 
The Sample mean is 28. Use alpha = 0.05 for a one-tailed test.

Best null hypothesis for this study is : Listening to music while studying will not improve memoryand may actually make it worse.

Best alternative hypothesis for this study  is : Listening to music will improve  memory.

Standard Error = 1

Z-score = 3

Z-Critical Value = 1.64

Based on the outputs we conclude that WE Reject the null and that listening to music significantly improved memomry at p<0.05.
