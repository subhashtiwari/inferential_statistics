A flower shop noted that its average sales every valentine's day are $7895 with SD $230. The last 5 yrs, 
they've implemented a new marketing starategy to hopefully increase sales. Their average sales over the last 
5 years is $9640.

At alpha=0.01, the probabililty of obtaining at least this mean = .0001

Thus we reject the null. And conclude that the marketing strategy has no effect on sales.
