Hypothesis Problem

Ho : Most dogs have four legs.(50% or above)
Ha : Most dogs have less than four legs.

From a sample of 10 dogs we found that all have four legs.
Thus we failed to prove that the Null Huothesis is true (as the Ho was about having most of dogs having 4 legs not all of them) or 
in other words we 'reject the null'.

If we change the results so that now there are now 6 dogs having 3 legs then, there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
