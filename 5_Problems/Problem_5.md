A new training technique supposed to decrease how long it takes professional sprinters to run 
200-meter races(i.e. this training will increase their speeds). A trainer takes a random sample 
of female sprinters and records how long it takes sprinters to run 200 meters after training.

The trainer finds that the average time it takes the population of female sprinters to run 200 meters is 22.965 seconds with SD 0.360, mean = .360.

The trainer's SE for the distribution of sample means comes out to be = .09.

The Z-score of this sample mean = -1.91

It means that female sprinters are significantly faster after training.
