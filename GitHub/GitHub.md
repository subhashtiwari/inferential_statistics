First of all make an account in GitHub and Install the GitHub app.

Now make a new repository. Let it be first_one.

And choose the Public one then click on Create Repository.

Create a new folder in Desktop. Name it Intro.

Now open the GitHub app and choose File then Clone Repository. After this a window will appear.

In this in place of Local Path choose the folder that you created earlier, i.e. Intro. Also, remember to write the repository name as it was.

After cloning is done when you open the Git app u will see your recently created repository name in the left upper corner.

And just below that there are two windows Changes and History.
In the changes u will see 0 changed files.
