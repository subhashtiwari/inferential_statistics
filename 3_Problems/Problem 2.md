A medical doctor wants to reduce blood pressure in his hypertensive patients by teaching them to meditate.
He finds that the mean systolic blood pressure for the population of stage 2 hypertensive patients (those with 
high blood pressure) is 180 mmHG (mean=180). with a standard deviation of 18 mmHG. After teaching a sample of 9
patients to mediate, he obtains a sample mean of 175. If he taught all his patients to mediate, could it reduce 
their average blood pressure? To answer this, he decides to calculate a 99% CI for this average.
The Critical values of Z for 99% CI is (+/-)2.57


We find out the Standard error of the mean = 6.
The Probability of obtaining the 175 mean or lower = .20.
The Margin of error to be 15.42.
The CI Range for 99% (159.58,190.57).
By the data we obtained its not possible to reach to a conclusion on if meditation lowers blood pressure or not.
But if the Doctor allows meditation for all future patients like his sample patients then the mean blood pressure would
fall between 160 to 190 mmHG.
