A Chemistry teacher wants to improve exam scores by incorporating more interactive in-class activities.
The mean exam score for all her previous classes is 68% with standard deviation 10%. After trying out the
interactive in-class activities for her current class, this class got a score of 75%. There were 25
students in the class. She decides to calculate a 95% CI for what the average exam score would be if she 
continued this method for all classes.


Now we know that Sample Size is 25 SD is 10%, mean exam score is 68%.
We find that Standard Error to be 2%. by using the formula explained in previous chapters.
Now we obtain the probability of obtaining the mean i.e. 75% or greater by using Z-table and that comes out to be .206
As we have obatined both the SE and Probability we find the Margin of Error(half the width of 95% CI) is 3.92
And hence the Confidence Interval is (71.08,78.92).
And thus we conclude that if we incorporate more in-class interactive activities. Then 
            1. It will be more effective than the previous one
            2. If she continued with this neew way then the mean exam score for all students would be between 71% to 79%.
