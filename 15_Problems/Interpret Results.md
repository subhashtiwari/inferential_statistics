1. If people knew more about a particular prescription drug, are they more likely to desire it? Callaghan, Laraway , Snycerski, and McGee (2013) investigated this by correlating a numerical score for knowledge about the drug (with higher score indicating more knowledge) and self reported desire to seek that drug from a doctor. In a condition in which participants viewed a TV commercial for the drug, the relationship between drug-knowldge scores and drug-seeking scores was negatively correlated with r = -.25 (95% CI = -.37, -.12). What does this mean?

Knowing more about the drug was associated with desiring the drug less.

2. We do a hypothesis test for the true population correlation coefficient and calculate our t-statistic to be 2.306.
If there were 45 data values in our study (45 x-values and 45 y-values)?
We Reject the Null
That means we're sure that there is  atrue linear relationship between x & y. As the t-critical we obtained = 1.684

3. Which of the following examples of correlation positive or negative?

    1.  As a person runs more miles, they report more intense leg pain. : Positive
    2.  As employees work more hours on a shift, their productivity decreases. : Negative
    3.  As a person drinks more coffee, their ability to focus decreases. : Negative
    4.  The greater the square footage of one's home, the more costly it is to heat. : Positive

4. As the size of our sample increases, the size of the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) that we will need to reach significance gets smaller.
