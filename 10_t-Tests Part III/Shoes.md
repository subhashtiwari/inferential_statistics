It is based on the data collected at Udacity on who have more shoes males or females.

The Null hypothesis : Both have same number number of shoes.
Alternative hypothesis : Either male have more shoes than females or females have more shoes than males.

Based on the data provided we calculate the mean of and SD of both.
Mean of F = 33.14       Mean of M = 18
SD of F = 31.36         SD of M = 34.27

What is the standard error?
Standard Error= 15.72

What is the t-statistics?
t-statistics = .96

What is the type of test we used?
We use two tailed test.

What is the t-critical value?
t-critical value =(+/-) 2.12.

What is the decision based on the result?
We Accept the Null.

What is the 95% of CI for the true difference between the two groups.
THere can be two values for mean and t-critical values, mean = (+/-) 15.14, t-critical = (+/-) 2.12 and the SE = 15.72.
So, 95% CI = ( -18.19,48.47 ).

What proportion of the difference in pair of shoes owned can be attributed to gender?
It is calculated by r squared test = .054.
