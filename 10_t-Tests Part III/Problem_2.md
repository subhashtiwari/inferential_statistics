Two scientist developed two drugs(Drug A & Drug B) that cure the acne and both of them tested 
them on 6 & 5 different peoples. We got the data for which we will perform different tasks.

Drug A          Drug B 
40%             41%
36%             39%
20%             18%
32%             23%
45%             35%
28%

We calculte the SD and mean that comes out to be 
SD of A = 8.89%     Mean of A = 33.5%
SD of B = 10.16     Mean of B = 31.2%

Now perform two tailed tests two find out the effect of these two drugs.
So, the null hypothesis is that population of those who used drug A will not be significantly different from the population that use drug B.

And, the Alternative hypothesis will be that tey will be significantly different.

Now, Clculate the t-statistics?
t-statistics = .39

Now, Calculate the t-critical value?
t-critical value = 2.262

Now we make the decision on wheather to accept or reject the null?
We will accept the null.
