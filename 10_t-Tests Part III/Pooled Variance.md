In this we find the pool variances and thus get the new standard error is Sp^2. It will help in correcting the Standard Error.

In this when we have two samples, we'll add the sum of the squares for each, and then divide by the sum of the degrees of freedom.

As an example 

X       Y
5       3
6       7
1       8
-4

Sum of squares for X= 62
Sum of squares for Y=14

Pooled Variance?
Sp^2 = 15.2

Now the corrected Standard Error is 2.97.

What is the t-statistics?
t-statistics = -1.34

t-critical values = (+/-) 2.571 for alpha level 0.05.
