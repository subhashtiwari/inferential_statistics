With independent samples, we can do an
1. Experimental test where we give treament to the subjects.
2. Or observational where we simply observe characteristics of two different populations, and then compare them.

Though dependent samples have some advantages and disadvantages such as:

Advantages
- Controls for individual differernces
- Use fewer subjects
- Cost-effective
- Less time consuming
- Less expensive

Disadvantages
- Carry-over effects : Second measurement can be affected by first treatment.
- Order may influence results.

Though the, Standard Error changes because it's based on two sample sizes and the two standard deviations. It is clearly shown in the image Sandard Error.
