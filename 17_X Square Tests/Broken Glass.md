There are 150 students who were divided into 3 groups and asked about the same accident in different words?

Group 1 : How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?

Group 2 : How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?

Group 3 : Asked no question about the speed of cars.

1. And after one week they were all asked same question "Did you see any broken glass?".

Group 1 : 7/50 
Group 2 : 16/50
Group 3 : 6/50

There is a image named Broken Glass showing the tables to easily interpret the data.

2. What is the Null Hypothesis?

Ho : Students' respose for whether or not they saw broken glass is independent of the wording used in the question?

3. What is the chi square value?

chi square = 7.778

4. What is the degree of freedom?

df = 2

5. What is the decision?

We Reject the Null because the value of chi square statistics critical value = 5.99. 

6. What is the value of Cramer's V?

Cramer's V = 0.2277
