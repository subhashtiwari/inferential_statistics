It shows hoe well the observed frequencies "fit" the expected frequencies?

It is called chi squared goodness of fit test.

While calculating the chi squared statistics, we take the observed frequency, f for frequency, sub o for observed minus the expected frequency, square it divide by the expected frequency and then sum them up. As we have more than one observed frequency.
We square it to get rid of the negative values.

Chi sqyare values are never negative, and therefore a chi-squared test is one-directional.

The more categories, the more likely we'll get a larger chi square statistics.

# Assumptions and Restrictions for Chi - Square Test 

1. Avoid dependent observations : Independence would be voilated if the participants contribute to data in more than just one of the cells.

2. Avoid small expected frequencies, have large number of participants. The total number oof participants should be at least 20. And each cell frequency should be at least 5.


Chi square tests can check how well observed values fit the expected values for categorical data.
There can be as many as we need for a particualr categorical value.
