Doctor Rogers want to climb Mount Shasta this summer, but he needs statistics to help make some decisions. According to summitpost.org only about 33% of hte 15000 summit attempts each year are succesful. 
But Dr Rogers plans to make his summit attempt with the aid of a professional guide company. He is considering a guide company called Summit Up. They state that of the 100 trips they had last year, 41 succesfully reached the summit. 
Does this represent a significantly better success rate than would be expected by chance?
