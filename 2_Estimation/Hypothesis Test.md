In this we conduct a study of adding an external effect that may effect the data and change the Engagaement ratio.
Like what is the rate of learning maths while listening to music so the data music is a hypothesis test that's been included, but its been applied only to a limited no of users.
thus when we apply the test i.e. Music for all the students then the value we obtain using Engagaement Ratio formula is called as Point Estimate Engagaement Ratio.
