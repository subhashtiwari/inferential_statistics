In this we calculate the engagement ratio using the data provided
it is calculated as the ratio of Number of minutes watched to the Total minutes available in the dataset.
To work on an excel sheet we use google spreadsheet. We copy paste the data into a new one and find the mean and Standard Deviation using formulae
For Mean: =average(starting block:ending block)
For Standard Deviation: 1. Variance: (Xn-mean) ; Xn- it is the data provided for analysis.
                        2. =sqrt(Variance) ; In the place of Variance we put the block no like b2 c3 etc, in whichever place the variance is stored. 
                        The sqrt function automatically computes the data and gives the answer i.e. Standard Deviation.
