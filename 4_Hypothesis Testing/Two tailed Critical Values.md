In two tailed Critical values there are two critical values one positive and other negative, as in this case for 0.05 the values are (+/-)1.96.
For the Sample Mean 7.13 Z-score is (-2.59). Foloowing Two-Tailed Test at alpha=0.05, we conclude that:
        1. It is unlikely to have gotten a mean engagement score of 7.13.
        2. There is evidence that Katie singing made student less engaged.
        3. A mean engagement score of 7.13 is significant at p<0.05.

The Z-critical values for alpha=0.01 are (+/-)2.57.
The Z-critical values for alpha =0.001 are (+/-)3.27.

There is significant difference in the Z-critical values for the same alpha levels and it is shown in Comaparison image.
