Alpha level is the range which divides the Confidence Interval Range from the distribution.
For the Alpha levels following points are true:
        1. If the probability of getting a particular sample mean is less than 'alpha' , it is "unlikely" to occur. 
        2. If a sample mean has a z-score greater than z*, it is unlikely to occur.

For the alpha=0.01  Z-score for this critical region is = 2.33. We found this using Z-table.
For the alpha=0.001 Z-score for the critical region is = 3.09.
If the Z-score falls in any of the three alpha regions, then there is the probability that the test affected the sample population greatly, depending on which critical region the Z-scores falls in.
If the study shows that the obtained Z-score is not enough as predicted then the study is termed as a faliure.
The probability of getting the mean on any of the critical region shows that it didn't happened by chance & thus we can conclude various results on this basis.
