There are some points that should be remembered:

1. The alpha level is smaller for smaller critical regions.
2. The critical region defines unlikely values if the null hypothesis is true.
3. When the Z-score is large (e.g. more than 3.00), we reject the null hypothesis.
4. When we accept the null hypothesis we believe that the treatment has no effect, based on the samples.
5. An effect that exists is more likely to be detected if sample size is large.
6. An effect that exists is less likely to be detected if SD is large.
