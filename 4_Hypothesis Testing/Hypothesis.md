There are teo types of Hypothesis 
        1. Ho (null hypothesis)
        2. Ha (alternative hypothesis)

Ho Null Hypothesis
It occurs when the current population mean is equal(not significantly different) to the population mean 
after intervention.

Ha Alternative Hypothesis
There are three types of Ha
        1. When Current population mean is less than after the intervention.
        2. When it is more than after the intervention.
        3. When it is significntly different but we don't determine if it is less or more.

When there is Ho then the sample mean will not lie in the critical region.
When there is Ha then the sample mean will lie in the critical region.
