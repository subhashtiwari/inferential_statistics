Hypothesis Testing is prone to misinterpretations.
As in the case of 4 legged dogs what if all the dogs we get for the sample have met some kind of accident and thus have less than 4 legs. 
Or what if there is no dog having any of legs missing.

Thus depending upon the types of sample we take into consideration for our testing there can be some errors in deciding the output.
