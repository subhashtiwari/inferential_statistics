There are three types of deigns for Dependent Sample measurement.

1. Repeated measures design : in this case the Null hypothesis Ho : both the population means are same.

2. Longitudnal : In this we measure the sample at a time and remeasure all after some some and see if there is any difference in the study.
The null hypothesis for this : If there is no difference after the time span.

3. Pretest Posttest : In this we measure the same sample before applying any treatment and again measure the same sample after applying the treatment.

The Null Hypothesis : If both the means are same.
