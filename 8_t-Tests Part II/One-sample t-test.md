Now we are going to do a full one-sample t-test that includes the t-test, the cofidence interval, Cohen's d and r squared, just like in a real research study. 
We need some important formulae and tools that are shown in these two images named 'Tools 1&2'.

1. We need to write down all of the work as we do it.
2. Write down and lable all the values, every intermediate step. As we will need the values throughout the test.
3. Round evry answer to two decimal places.
