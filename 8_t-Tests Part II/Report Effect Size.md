If we want to present our effect size measures. This could be Cohen's d, r squared or others or both.
In APA style write  d=x.xx or r^2=.xx.
Though in APA style we don't use a leading zero for situations in which we have proportions. If the value cannot be greater than 1, we don't need a zero in the first place.
For example r^2 = .17 not 0.17.

But Cohen's d can be greater than one so we would write d= 0.25
