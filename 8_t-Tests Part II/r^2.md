r^2 : It gives the strength of the relationship between two variables. 
It is also called the coefficient of determination.
As it is a proportion and it ranges from 0.00 to 1.00.
Where 0.00 represents that the variables are not at all related and perfect 1.00 means that they are perfectly related.

The formula for r^2 can be derived from t tests and is shown in image r^2. 

For example if we follow the formula then for t=2, DOF=20 hten r^2 = .166.
