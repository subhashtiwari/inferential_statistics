To report a result we follow some steps. This is called as "Result Section".

1. The first thing we put into it are Descriptive Statistics like the Mean, Standard Deviation.
Descriptive statistics tells exactly what happened in our study and should always be reported.
It can be reported in 3 ways. We can report them in:
        - Text
        - Graphs
        - Tables

2. Next we report our Inferential Statistics this is either a Hypothesis test or Confidence Interval.
So when reporting a hypothesis test we want to give information about the type of test we conducted like, one sample t-test.
Then the t-statistics, then degrees of freedom of the test (the actual value), the exact p-value, then the direction of the test: if it is one tailed or two tailed.
We always provide the alpha level that we used to make the decision.

We normally use APA (American Psycological Association) style. APA has a whole guide on writing research papers and one of the parts of that guide tells us how to write 
inferential statistical results.
The style is given as follows:

t(df)=X.XX, p=.XX, direction.

First we put the test statistics name, in this case it's t. Next we put the degrees of freedom in parentheses.
We put an equal sign, then we provide the t-value, rounded to two decimal places with a comma, then we give the p-value. 
Again,rounded to two decimal places. There are some exceptions in this rule but it's how its done. Now we put the comma and tell the direction of the test whether it's one tailed or two tailed.

For example : t(24) = -2.50, p<.05, one-tailed. p=.01
