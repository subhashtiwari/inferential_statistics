In reporting Confidence Interval we need to know the Confidence Interval e.g. 95%
We need to know the lower limit, the upper limit and make sure you identify what the confidence interval is for.
For example the CI on the difference between two means. 
It can be represented as 95% CI = (4,6) : In the parentheses there is Upper limit and Lower limit.
