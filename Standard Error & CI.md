For the distribution we have calculated the mean  i.e. 0.077 and standard Error i.e. 0.024
When the sample size was 20 then the mean engagement ration was 0.13.
So we need to find how many Standard errors 0.13 is from the mean.
Now we found the CI (.083,.177).
The generalised formula for 95% CI is shown in figure.
