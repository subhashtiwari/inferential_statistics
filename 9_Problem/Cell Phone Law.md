The law will reduce the number of accidents due to  cell phone use.

Which t-test would eb used here?
One tailed test in the negative direction.

What is the t-critical values for alpha = 0.05?
It is -1.833

What is ths Standard Error, if the Standard deviation of the differences is 1.33?
Its .42.

What is the t-statistics?
Its -7.13.

What will be the conclusion based on all these results?
We Reject the Null as the results are statistically significant and p<0.05.

What is the Cohen's d?
It is 2.255.

And last What is the Confidence Interval?
