Hypothesis Testing for Slope

It has same same sa hypothesis test for 'r'. If the test for 'r' is significant, then the test for slope will also be significant.

The equation y = bx + a becomes y = (beta1)x + (beta0) for the population parameters, where the beta1 : population slope, beta0 : population y-intercept. And b = sample slope & a = sample y-intercept.

So, the Hypothesis testing for slope is
Ho : beta1 = 0
Ha : beta1 < 0
     beta1 > 0
     beta1 not equal to zero

t-Test for Slope

It is type of test that uses the t distribution and t-table and t-statistics that we can calculate either manually or by using QuickCalc.
Once we know all the data we can make the decision on when to reject or fail to reject the null. The degrees of freedom are N-2, N is no of data points.
