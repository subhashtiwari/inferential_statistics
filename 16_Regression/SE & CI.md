To quantify this calculate the standard deviation. Take each residual and then square them to remove negative values. It's just like finding area of each squares and then divide it by N-2, where N is the number of points. And then take the square root to put it back into terms of distance rather than squared values.

This is called the Standard Error of the estimate. It will estimate the accuracy of the predictions.

The prediction can be made more accurate by computing Confidence Intervals for our predicted values.
CI for slope can tell the range for which the true population slope might be.
