1. The CI for the slope of the regression line is (-0.684, 1.733. What can be concluded by this?

We can conclude the following 
1. The correlation coefficient r is not significant.
2. The slope of the regression line for the sample data is definitely between -0.684 and 1.733.
3. The true slope for the population (B1 hat) could be negative.
