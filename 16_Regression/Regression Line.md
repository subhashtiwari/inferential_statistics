To analyse this this line we need to know where it hits the y-axis and at what angle. This angle. This angle is generally reffered to as the slope. It is the amount that y changes, when x changes by 1 unit.
In case of regression this line represents how much y is expected to change, when x change by 1 unit.
It can be written as either x plus the y-intercept or as y-intercept plus the slope times x.

The slope and y-intercepts aare called regression coefficients.

We can use 'a' to symbolize the intercept and 'b' to symbolize the y-intercept.

We can find the line of best fit by finding the line that minimizes the sum of all the residuals. The residuals can be either negative or positive. And thus these negative and positive residuals would just balance each other out.
There could be a line of best fit that doesn't go through the points at all, but still has a very small sum of residuals.

As we know
b = r(standard deviation of y-values)/(standard deviation of x-values), we can also symbolize the regression line like this:
y = r(standard deviation of y-values)/(standard deviation of x-values)x + a.
