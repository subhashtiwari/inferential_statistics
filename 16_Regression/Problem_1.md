Using a scatterplot shown in image Airplane Flights. It shows the expected value of the dependent variable Y, for any value of the independent variable.
Lets assume x value to be 1500 miles, the flight cost is almost $750, this is the observed value. 
But according to our line of best fit a flight that travels 15000 miles would cost more like $450. These expected value for any x value are symbolized by y hatt. Whereas hte observed values are just regular y values.

If we travel around 5010 miles this costs $1500 but according to our line of best fit this should cost about $1200.

As it is clear that there is difference between our observed and expected value. This difference is called the residual. There is residual for every point in the data set. It might be 0, or it might be huge.

1. Now we calculate r from the data provided.
r = .909    &   r squared = 0.83

2. Now calculate Standard Deviation.
Sy = 508.18     Sx = 2315.3

3. What is the slope?
b = .199

4. How to calculate y-intercept? 
We can calculate this if we know a point that lie in its path. And that point is the mean that is provided by the data.

5. What is y-intercept?
By using the mean values the Y-intercept = 160.15

6. What will be the cost to travel 4000 miles?
Cost = $960.15

7. What is the additional cost per mile?
Additional cost = 0.2

8. What will be the cost if it travels 0 miles?
160.83

9. For $500, what is the farthest distance that can be travelled?
1700 miles.
