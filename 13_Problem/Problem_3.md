First-born children tend to develop language skills faster than their younger siblings. One possible explanation for this phenomenon 
is that first-borns' have undivided attention from their parents. If this explanation is correct, then it is reasonable that twins 
should show slower language development tahn single children and that triplets should be even slower. The following data were obtained 
from several families. The data is measure of language skill at age three for each child. The higher the score, the better the language skill.

1. What is the Null Hypothesis?
All the means are equal.

2. What is the Alternate Hypothesis?
One or more than one mean are statistically different.

3. What is the sum of squares for between-groups?
SS between = 40

4. What is the sum of squares for within-groups?
SS within = 42

5. What are the degree of freedoms?
df between = 2
df within = 12

6. What are the Mean of Squares?
MS between = 20
MS within = 3.5

7. What is the F-Statistics?
F-statistics = 5.714

8. What is F-critical value at alpha = 0.05?
F-critical value = 3.885

9. What is the decision?
As the F-stat > F-crit we should Reject the Null.
