Cohen's d can also be used for multiple comparisons. THis is measure of effect size. As we know that Cohen's is thr difference between 
sample means divided by thhe pooled standard deviation in the case of independent samples tea tests.
Square root of the means squared for within subject variability is essentially the pooled standard deviation.

1. Calculate 3 cohen's d, one for each pair of samples.
A - B = -3  
B - C = -3
A - C = -6
