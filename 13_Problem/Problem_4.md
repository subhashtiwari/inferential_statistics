For the following Quizes answer are given.

1. An anlysis of variances produce dfbetween = 2 and dfwithin = 24. For this analysis, what is dftotal?

dftotal = 26

2. In a study examinig the effects of noise on memory performance, the null hypothesis would state that:
Noise will not affect memory performance.

3. A researcher reported F(3,24) = 5.30 for a one-way ANOVA. How many individuals participated in the entire experiment?

28 individuals.

4. A researcher computed an F-ratio of -4.35, with df = (3,25)? What decision should the researcher make with respect to the null hypothesis if a = 0.05?

The F-value cannot be negative thus no decision.

5. An analysis of variance produces SStotal = 200 and SSwithin = 50. For this analysis, what is SSbetween?

SSbetween = 150.

6. For ANOVA F test, the smaller the MS within, the greater the likelyhood that you reject the null hypothesis. Is is true or False.

This is True as MS within is in the denominator and less MS within will result in higher F-stat thus reject the null.
