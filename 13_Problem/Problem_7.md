1. For an F-ratio with df = 2,30. Find the critical value for a hypothesis test using alpha = 0.05.

F-critical = 3.3158

2. If the obtained F-ratio is 1.20, what is the correct decision?

Retain the Null.

3. For an F-ratio with df = 3.15. Find the critical value for a hypothesis test using alpha = 0.05.

F-critical = 3.287

4. If the obtained F-ratio is 5.26, what is the correct decision?

Reject the Null.

5. What is SSwithin if SStotal = 200 and SSbetween = 60?

SSwithin = 140

6. SSwithin can also be called?
SSbg and SSerror.

7. A one-way ANOVA with four groups and 30 subjects will produce an F-statistics with df=?
3,26

8. What are the Hypothesis for one-way ANOVA?
Null : All population means are equal.

Alternative : At least two population means are different.

9. After finding significant results in ANOVA we should conduct post-hoc tests. True or False?
True

10. If Tukey's HSD test gives us a value of HSD = 2.49, what decision should we make if the mean difference between two groups is 2.10?

The difference is not honestly significant: retain the null.

11. If Tukey's HSD test gives us a value of HSD = 3.20, what decision should we make if the mean difference between two groups is 4.50?

The difference is honestly significant: reject the null.

12. What is eta squared if SSbetween = 20 and SStotal = 100.

eta squared = .20

13. eta squared = .17. What does this tells us?

We can explain 17% of the variabillity in the dependent variable using the independent variable.

14. F(1,30) = 1.10. If alpha = 0.05 what is the final decision?

We will retain the null.

15. F(2.50) = 12.13. If alpha = 0.05 what is the final decision?

We will reject the null.

16. What is SSbetween if SStotal = 100 and SSwithin = 10?

SSbetween = 90.
