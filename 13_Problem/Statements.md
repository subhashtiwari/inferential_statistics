All of these are solved statements.

1. As the variabilty within the treatment group "Increases", the likelyhood of rejecting the null hypothesis.

2. In ANOVA , the differences between treatment groups(between-group variances) contributes to "the numerator of the F-Ratio".

3. Treatment effects would only increase variability between groups within a treatment group.

4. As the variability between treatment grouups gets larger and larger (assuming the with-in group variability remains relatively constant), the likelyhood of rejecting the null hypothesis Increases.

5. If the null hypothesis is true, then on average the F-ratio for ANOVA is expected to have a value near 1.00.

6. One of the greatest advantages of ANOVA is that it allows researchers to compare more than two treatment conditions without having to conduct multiple hypothesis test.

7. Large mean differences and small within-group variabilty is most likely to produce a large F value.

8.
