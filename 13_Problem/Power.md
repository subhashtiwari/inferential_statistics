To reduce the two errors that are
1. Failing to reject the null when we should have.
2. When we fail to find treatment effects when they actually exist.

As the research is consuming and expensive, we need to make it likely that we find statistical significance when we should.
We do this by increasing the power, there are various ways to increase power.

Take the example If we're testing the effects of different drugs we want to:

1. test more people.
2. give each drug to very similar groups of people.
3. test a large dose of the medication.

Larger samples result in hgher power.
Lower within-group variablity leads to higher power.
Choosing treatment with strong effect sizes will increase power.
