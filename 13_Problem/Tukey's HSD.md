One of the most common comparison test is called Tukey's HSD, which stands for Honestly Significant Difference It's named after John Tukey, 
a very influential statiscian.
Tukey's HSD evaluates the significance of the difference between any two group means. In statistics, we say that this test will allow us to 
make pairwise comparisons. The way we calculated Tukey's HSD is like the margin of error that you've learned before. 
With z-test, it was the z-critical value, denoted z-star times the standard error. And remember with t test, it was the t-critical value times 
the standard error. 
But when comparing three or more samples, we have a new statistics called Q. And we multiply this by this square root of the mean square for 
within subject variability divided by n.
The mean square for within subject variability is the pooled variance. Its just the average square deviation of each value from its espective 
group mean. So, the square root is the pooled standard deviation. Q is the student highest range statistics, and we find this in yet another 
table. It's purpose is to adjust the whole HSD, so that it's less likely we commit a type one error. A type one error is when we reject the null 
hypothesis when it's actually true sice q increases when there are more groups that we're comparing, it makes it less likely to commit a type one error. 
If a sample mean was further away from the population mean, than the margin of error, it was considered unlikely. If means are further apart than the 
Tukey's HSD then that's considered honestly.


1. Calculate Tukey's HSD for the cow's problem, and find if the sample means for the amount of food cows ate is honestly significantly different. Use studentized range statistics table to find the critical value of q. 

For alpha = 0.05  Tukey's HSD = 2.51.

2. This HSD value means that if any two samples, have an absolute difference greater than 2.51, the difference is considered honestly significant. Which are significantly different A and B, B and C, or A and C? Or, are two of these differences significant, or are all significant?

All the three are significantly different.
