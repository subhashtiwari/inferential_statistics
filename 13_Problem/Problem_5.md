To improve the lives of dairy cows, a researcher examined 3 types of foods, they wanted to access cows preference for one 
food over the other all were equally nutritous and affordbale. Together the farmer and the researcher gave the cows each 
type of food there were nine cows bessie, frank and slim got food A. Bob, red and Pippin got food B. Sam, merry and chip 
got food C. They were randomly assigned to eah type of food. over eight hours this is the amount that these cows consumed 
in pounds. The data is given in bar graph and shown in image named Bar Graphs.

1. What is the Independent Variable?
The type of food.

2. What is the Dependent Variable?
The amount eaten in pounds.

3. What is the Null Hypothesis?
The Cows will eat similar amounts of food.

4. What is the Alternative Hypothesis?
The cows will eat more or less of at least one food over another.

5. What is the Grand Mean?
Xg = 6

6. Group Mean of each group?
Xa = 3  Xb = 6  Xc = 9

7. What is SSbetween?
SSbetween = 54

8. What is SSwithin?
SSwithin = 6

9. What are the Degrees of Freedom?
df between = 2
df within = 6

10. What is the Mean's Squares?
MS between = 27
MS within = 1

11. What is the F-statistics?
F-statistics = 27

12. What is F-critical for alpha = 0.05?
F-critical = 5.1433

13. What is the decision?
We will reject the null.

14. What is the Deviation from the Grand Mean?
Deviation from the Grand Mean = 60

15. What is SStotal?
SStotal = SSbetween + SSwithin = 60

16. What is the conclusion?
At least two foods significantly differ from each other in terms of the amount eaten by the cows.
