Desert ants have a nifty wawy of finding their way back home afetr a foray out of the nest to find food they count their steps. To prove it, some scientist devised a creative experiment that showed just how the little guys do it. NPR's Robert Krulwich, Oddtodd, Jason Orfanon.

Below is some fictitious data that is consistent with the study described in the video. The table below list how close each ant got to their nest using either short-, long-, or normal-legs.

            Short   Long    Normal
            -8      12       0.5
            -11     9        0.0
            -17     16      -1.0
            -9      8        1.5
            -10     15       0.5
            -5              -0.1
                              0

Mean :      -10     12       0.2

1. What is the Grand Mean?
Grand Mean = 0.077

2. What is the SSbetween?
SSbetween = 1320.66

3. What is the SSwithin?
SSwithin = 133.48

4. What are the degrees of freedom?
dfbetween = 2   
dfwithin = 15

5. What are the Mean Squares?
MSbetween = 660.33
MSwithin = 8.89        

6. What is the F-Ratio and F-critical for alpha = 0.05?
F-Ratio = 74.27
F-Critical = 3.682

7. What is the decision?
We'll Reject the Null. And we coclude that the Leg Length has a significant impact on the ability of ants to navigate to their nests.

8. What is eta squared?
eta squared = .908

9. What does eta squared tell us?
The proportion of the variance explained by the difference in leg length.
