eta squared is an effect size measure for one way ANOVA.
It is like r^2 in t-test and it has same interpretation in ANOVA. This effect size tells us the proportion of total variation that is due to between group differences.

This is also called explained variation. 

It is calculated as the ratio of " SSbetween to the SStotal ".

The eta square for Cow problem = 0.9. It indicates 90% difference in the amount eaten is due to the differences in food types. 
According to Jacob Cohen anything bigger than 0.14 is considered big.

The range of eta square is 0-1. 
0 means that all the means are significantly different. As the difference between means can never be negative so it can never be lower than 0.
1 means that the between group variabilty equals the total variability. Meaning that there is no within group variability.
