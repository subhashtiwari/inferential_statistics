We report the on-way ANOVA as shown below:

F(2,6) = 27    p < 0.05    eta squared = 0.90    

F-statistics as function of two degrees of freedom, between and within, p value and eta squared.
When we manually do it the p-value is supposed to be less than 0.05.

If we use software then we will know the exact p-valueso representation changes.

F(2,6) = 27    p = 0.05    eta squared = 0.90

But in researches there are large samples and we can't do ANOVA maually so we use software.
