In order to use one way ANOVA we nned to make some assumptions.

1. Normality : All populations from which the samples are from are normally distributed.

2. Homogenity of Variance : The data comes from populations that have equal amount of variability and finally independence of observations. 

However, we can violate these assumptions under certain conditions.
1. If the sample size is large : Violate Normality
2. Nearly equal sample sizes and ratio of any two variances does not exceed 4 : Violate Homogenity of variance
