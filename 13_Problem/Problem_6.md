Now lets do a problem with different sample sizes.

In a study to reduce tumor size in breast cancer, researchers analysed the effect of a placebo pill and three types of drugs.
After each treatment was administered, the researcher observed the reduction of tumor diameter in centimeters. 20 people had tumors.

            Placebo    Drug1   Drug2   Drug3
            1.5         1.6     2.0     2.9
            1.3         1.7     1.4     3.1
            1.8         1.9     1.5     2.8     
            1.6         1.2     1.5     2.7
            1.3                 1.8
                                1.7         
                                1.4

1. Mean =  1.5         1.6     1.614   2.875
 
2. What is the Grand Mean?
Grand Mean = 1.835 

3. What is SSbetween?
SSbetween = 5.448.

4. What is SSwithin?
SSwithin = .8357

5. What are the degrees of freedom?
dfbetween = 3   
dfwithin = 16

6. What are the mean squares?
MSbetween = 1.82
MSwithin = .052

7. What is F-statistics?
F- statistics = 35

8. What proportion of the difference between tumor reductions is due to the type of drug?
eta squared = .867.
