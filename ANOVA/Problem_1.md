Now, perform ANOVA for the following problem.

There are 3 clothing brands Irisha Snapzi & LolaMoon.
Prices of all these brands are given as follows:

Snapzi      Irisa       LolaMoon
15          39          65
12          45          45  
14          48          32  
11          60          38

1. Mean s = 13     Mean i = 48     Mean l = 45

2. Now calculate the Grand Mean Xg = (13+48+45)/3 = 35.33.

3. Now Find the Sum of Squares between groups, using each sample mean and the grand mean.
SS-between = 3010.67.

4. Now find the sum of squares for within subject variability. In this, take sum of each value and subtract the respective mean. Then square it. Then we add them all together.
We need to calculate each deviation of each value from the respective mean. Square them and add them all up. Do the same for every sample. And then add up each sum of squares. 

SS-within = 862.

5. Now find the Degrees of freedom. Now there are two dof.
df-between = 2 : There are 3 Groups, so 2 degrees of freedom.
df-within = 9 : In this we had 4 values in each group so n1+n2+n3-3 = 9.
