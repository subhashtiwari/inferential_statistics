As we know that t-test is a function of the distance that they are apart from each other. And the variability of each sample, which is Standard Error.
We found all this using pooled variance.
We can do the same for more than two samples, we have some kind ofdistance or variablity between means in the numerator, and some kind of error in the denominator.

We can compare more than two samples by : finding the average squared deviation of each sample mean from the total mean.
