In this problem we use tow types of keyboards to type 25 words text message in 30 seconds. All errors were recorded.

Now we find mean no of error for both the keyboards. 
Xq = 5.08 ; Xa = 7.8

Point estimate between the errors (q-a) = -2.72.

Now we find SD of the Differences 'S' = 3.69

t-statistics for the pair = -3.68

For the alpha = 0.05 the t-critical values = (+/-) 2.064.

On the basis of t-statistics and t-critical values we Reject the Nul.

Now we calculate Cohen's d = -.74

CI = (-4.24 , -1.20)

We can represent the mean difference as mu d. Instead of mu q - mu a.
