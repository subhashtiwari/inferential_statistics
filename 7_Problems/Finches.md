According to a study the average beak width = 6.07 mm.
DO finches today have different-sized beak widths than before?

Ho : mu = 6.07

Ha : mu < 6.07
     mu > 6.07
     mu not equal to 6.07

     the last alternative hypothesis is correct.
      As we are only interested if the finches have "Different" beak width, which they do have.

Now according to data the Sample Size is 500, so DOF = 499.

Now we find the sample mean and SD that are 6.46 and .3957 respectively.

Now we find the t-statistics that is 22.36.

Thus we "reject the null" because t-statistics is large and will fall to the extreme end of the graph.
Also getting the population mean = 6.47 is almost impossible for population with mean = 6.07.
