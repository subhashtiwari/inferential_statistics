How do kids' vocabularies improve overtime? Early childhood education researchestook a random sample of 4-year-olds in the U.S. (n=1000) and had them say a few sentences. On average, the 4-year-olds used 3 words per sentence with SD 1.2. Four years later, when the kids were 8, the researchers repeated this with those same kids and tihs time they used 12 words per sentence on average, with SD 2.7.

Q1. What kind of study is this?
Longitudnal and Dependent samples t-test.

Q2. What is the inddependent variable?
Kid's Ages.

Q3. What is Dependent Variable?
Number of words kids use per sentence on average.

Q4. What is the null hypothesis?
Kids' vocabularies do not change between age 4 and 8.

Q5. What should the alternative hypothesis be?
Kids' vocabularies improve between age 4 and 8.

Q6. Which test should we use one-tailed or two-tailed?
In this case we use One-tailed test.

Q7. What is the t-critical value for an alpha level of 0.05?
It is 1.645.

Q8. What is mean difference and new standard deviation of the differences?
Mean = 9, Standard Deviation = 2.95.

Q9. What is the t-satistics and the conclusion?
The t-statistics = 96.47, and thus we reject the null.
