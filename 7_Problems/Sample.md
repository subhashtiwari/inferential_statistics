In this problem we take a Sample in which there are 8 values and thus we calculate the mean, Sample mean, 
the t-statistics.

Next we find the P-value for two tailed test that is = .3611
This is not statistically sinificant as P value is greater than the alpha value and thus we failed to reject the null.
