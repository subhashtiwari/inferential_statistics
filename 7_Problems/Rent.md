A renting company do some study and found out that there Mean rent = $1830.
And they examines a random samples of size 25 of their units and find that.
Mean = 1700 and S= $200

The Ho : mu = 1830
    Ha : mu not equal to 1830 

we have to find the t critical values for alpha=0.05 for two tailed test.
And its equal to (+/-)2.064

t-statistics = -3.25

thus we "Reject the null" as the t-statistics is less than the t-critical values.

This means that the Rental company charges significantly less.
