Correlation

It is a statistical technique that can show wheather and how strongly pairs of variables are related.
Such as, height and weight are related; taller people tend to be heavier than shorter people.

For the comparison we take two variables: 
1. X : It is called as a predictor, explanatory or independent variable.
2. Y : It is called as a outcome, response or dependent variable.

The relationship between the variables can be shown using a 
- Scatter Plot : For this the variables have to be numeric. They can't be categorical.
On X-axis we plot one variable and on Y-axis we plot another one. As shown in figure Scatter Plot.
The data will usually follow a liner trend.

If the plots that were made using the values of both the variables X & Y are very close to each other then it is called a strong relationship.
There are two types of relationship that define the direction of the trend.
1. Positive : X increases then Y increases or a line having a positive slope.
2. Negative : X increases then Y decreases or a line having a negative slope.

The correlation can either be stong or weak depending on the distribution of the values obtained using both variables.
There is an image named Relationship clarifying all these Correlations.
