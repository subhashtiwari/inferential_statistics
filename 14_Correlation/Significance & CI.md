For checking the significance of the result obtained we use t-test. It is same as that of the previous one.

And we have to conclude the result keeping in mind the result obtained from t-test. That is wheather we have to reject or accept the null.

The degree of freedom is N-2. where N is the number of variable.

As we know that the sample statistics often aren't exactly what population parameters are,so we need a Confidence Interval for true correlation.

It is the range of likely values for the population correlation coefficient 'rho'.

For calculating 'rho' we use graphpad.com quick calcs.
