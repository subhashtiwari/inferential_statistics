As we know that there is a relationship between the population. And to find that if the result we obtained are not due to chance as there are sampling error.
We check how much variation due to sampling error is allowable before we decide that our results are not due to chance.
As the output is 'r' that we get from sample data.
Rho, which looks like a p, is the true correlation for the population. 

Hypothesis Testing:

Ho : p = 0
Ha : p < 0          Negative Directional
     p > 0          Positive Directional
     p not equal 0  Non-Directional
