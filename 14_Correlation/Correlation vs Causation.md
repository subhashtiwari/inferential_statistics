Let's take some examples

1. A teacher notes that students in his jazz appreciation class really like the jazz music he plays. He concludes that the class is acusing them to enjoy jazz.

In this situation, perhaps students really liked jazz before and that's why they took the Jazz Appreciation class. Rather than the jazz appreciation class causing them to like jazz. 

Let's take another example

2. Researchers note that drug use is correlated with delinquincy. They conclude drug use causes delinquency and if we reduce drug use, we can decrease delinquency.

In this case, it is possibel that people were delinquent and that's why they started using drugs.

In both the examples there's ambiguous temporal precedence. We don't know which variable occured first, if it was the calss or the appreciation for jazz or if there was drug use and then delinqquency.

We can't infer causality.

3. Students who score high on SAT tend to have higher grades college. Therefore, by increasing students' SAT score, we can increase their grades in college.

There is a third variable problem.
It is not necessarily true that high SAT scores resulted in high grades in college. It could be that motivation, effort, intelligence etcetera was a third variable that influenced both SAT scores and grades.

4. Some people who commits violent act played violent video games before commiting violennt acts. These video games caused violence.

In this there is Post-hoc fallacy.
Just because a person played violent video games before commiting a violent act this doesn't mean that violent games caused the violent acts. It could be that people who want to commit violent crimes also want to play violent video games.

At last the main point is that 
Correlation is super-useful but that DOES NOT IMPLY CAUSATION.
