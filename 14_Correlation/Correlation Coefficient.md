The Number that quantifies the relationship is called correlation coefficient denoted by 'r'.
This is also known as Pearson's r.

r is a fraction, the numerator is the covariance of X and Y, cov(X,Y) it is a function. This means how much the X and Y will co vary.
In the denominator there is Standard Deviation of X times the standard deviation of Y. This describes how the two variable vary apart from each other rather than with each other. 
It i snot interpreted as a percentage. However, r squared is the percentage of the variation in Y explained by the variation in X.

r squared is called the coefficient of determination, it measures the strength of relationship by looking at how closely the data falls along a straight line. 
If it falls perfectly along a straight line in positive direction, then r is +1. And if it falls perfectly along a straight line in negative direction, r is -1. The data that does not correlate have r=0.
It is shown in a image named Pearson's r.

To calculate Pearson's r in the google spreadsheet, we write: 
= PEARSON (start cell for variable X : end cell for variable X,start cell for variable Y : end cell for variable Y)
