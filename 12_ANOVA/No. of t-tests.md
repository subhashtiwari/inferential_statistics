Till now we were calculating for significant difference in means between two independent samples.
But now we will compare means from more than two independent samples. 
If we have three samples then we have to do 3 t-tests, A&B, B&C and A&C.

But if we have 4 samples : A, B, C, D.
We have to use Brute force to find out or we can do Permutation of choosing 2 out of 4 which is 6.
It is shown in the image n samples.
