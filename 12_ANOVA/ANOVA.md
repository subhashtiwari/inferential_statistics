Analysis of Variance is called ANOVA. 
It can compare as many means as we want with just one test.
One way ANOVA when we hav eone independent variable sometimes called a factor.

Just like the t and z statistics we have to determine a statistics for this.

The Null hypothesis will be that : all the means are equal.

The Alternative Hypothesis can be that At least one pair of samples is significantly different.

The statistics is called F-Ratio.
