If we have more than two samples, and we find the mean of each sample. 
Will the mean of sample means in the case of four samples,  be the same as the means of all values in the each sample?

It will be sometimes same, when all the samples have same values thus the means of all the samples will be same and so will be the mean of all the values in each sample.

But if the samples are different then it will be different.
