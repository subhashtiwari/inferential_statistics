This test statistics measures whether or not there are significant differernces between 3 or more samples. 
We have to construct this statistics so that as within-group variabililty increases the test statistics Decreases. Meaning that the sample means are less likely to be different from each other.

The F-ratio is basically the ratio of the between group variabilty and within group variabilty.

As between group variabilty increases the whole test statistics increases and thus supports Ha more.

As the within group variabilty decreases the whole quotient decreases.
