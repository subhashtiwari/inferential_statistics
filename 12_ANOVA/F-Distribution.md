The F-Statistics is never negative.

Unlike the z and t tests, the disribution of the F-statisticsis not symmetrical. 
The F-distribution is positively skewed, meaning it peks on the left side and is streched off to the right side. 
The distribution peaks at 1. THis is because there are no difference in the population means, in other words the - between group variability expected to be 0.
The F-test is always non-directional. Wheresa in z and t-test, the 'Ha' could have been that one population mean is less than another.
With F-test , we only know if there's a significant difference. The critical region will always be out in the upper tail.
Everything else remains the same the alpha level is usually 0.05 and we check if the F-statistics lie in critical region or not.
If it lies in critical region, we know that at least two population means will be significantly different.
We check the critical values using F-table.
