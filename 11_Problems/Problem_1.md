For the data given for two variables calculate various parameters.

The solution is shown in the image named Problem 1.

The SSx = 58
SSy = 18.

The pooled variance  = 10.85.

The Standard Error = 2.209.

The t-satistics = - 4.074.

If the alpha level = 0.01 the t-critical values for a two tailed test  = (+/-) 3.499.

Tus we reject the null.
