In this problem we have two variables x and y.

The means for the respective variables is given and Sum of the Squares(SS) is also given.

Mean X = 3.8    nx = 18     SSx = 481    The alpha level is 0.01.
Mean Y = 2.1    ny = 25     SSy = 322

Now we have to calculate pooled variance, t-statistics and t-citical and make a decision based on the values.

So, we obtain the pooled variance = 1.88
 t-statistics = 31.57 and
t-critical = 2.626.

Thus as the t-stat > t-cric so we reject the null.
