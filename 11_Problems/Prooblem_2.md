A researcher examined the effects of two different incetives to improve behavior in two groups of boys diagnosed with ADHD. The researcher randomly assigned 10 boys to such group.
The boys earned points for every time tthey engaged in good behaviour (e.g., raising a hand to ask a question, helping a fellow student, completing assigned work).
Points could be exchanged for different incentives. For one group, the points coud be exchanged for extra time at recess. For the other group, the points could be exchanged for prizes from the school gift shop(e.g., pencils, small toys). 
The researcher measured the number of good behaviours in a single 20- minute class period. 

So, what is the independent variable here?
It is the type of incentive provided to children.

What is the dependent Variable?
It is the number of good behaviours in a single 20-minute class period.

What should be null hypothesis?
THere will not be a difference in the numberof good behaviors between the two incentive conditions.

What is the degree of freedom?
It is 18.

What is the t-critical values for a two-tailed test at alpha level = 0.05?
t-critical = (+/-) 2.101

What will be the t-statistics if the means are 10 and 7 and the SE = 0.94.
t-statistic = 3.19.

What should be the decision?
We should reject the null according to the t-values.  

What will be Cohen's d if Standard Deviation was = 2.33?
Cohen's d = 1.287.

What is the Percent of variability?
The measure of the proportion of change caused by one variable on the other is given by r square formula = t^2/(t^2+df).
So r^2 = 36.1%.
