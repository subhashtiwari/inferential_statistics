In this problem we have two variables x and y.

The means for the respective variables is given and pooeld variance is also given.

Mean X = 3.8    nx = 18     The alpha level is 0.05.
Mean Y = 2.1    ny = 25

Now we have to calculate t-statistics and t-citical and make a decision based on the values.

So, we obtain the t-statistics = 15.27 and
t-critical = 1.683.

Thus as the t-stat > t-cric so we reject the null.
